# Cloud Provider CIDR

A simple Symfony application that downloads IPv4 CIDR addresses from Cloud Providers to compile a simple list of public cloud CIDR's.
A CIDR list can be used to block/throttle incoming web requests, so crawlers/scrapers/spiders/bots can be more easily recognised and/or prevented.
